# Employee-Performance-Analysis
    Analyze employee performance with this comprehensive tool, providing insights and data-driven decisions for better workforce management.
    In the evolving landscape of remote work, accurately monitoring employee performance and work hours has emerged as a formidable challenge within our organization. The transition to remote work has ushered in a level of opacity and accountability concerns regarding how actively engaged our employees are and the amount of time they dedicate to their tasks. This lack of visibility poses obstacles to efficient project management, equitable resource allocation, and fair performance evaluations.
    To confront this pressing issue head-on, we propose the implementation of a comprehensive Employee Task and Time Tracking System. The primary objective of this system is to provide real-time insights into both individual and team progress on tasks, the allocation of time, and the rates of task completion. Through the introduction of this project, our aim is to reinstate accountability, bolster transparency, and foster a culture of data-driven decision-making in the context of remote work, thereby ensuring our organization's continued success in this dynamic work environment
    The core objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive performance assessment across various departments within the organization. This assessment will involve measuring completed work against predefined expectations to identify areas of excellence and areas requiring improvement among employees. Additionally, the project aims to evaluate the performance of different departments in various projects to ascertain effective collaboration and areas needing adjustments. Through this analysis, we seek to facilitate informed decision-making for enhancing overall work processes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement, and optimizing both workforce productivity and project outcomes. Ultimately, our objective is to promote data-driven decision-making to drive organizational success and efficiency.
# This project involves following steps
    •	Dataset
    •	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    •	EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis
    •	Feature Selection
    •	Model Building
Each of these steps are explained with the significance of visualizations.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
        Index that are present in the dataset
        Finding out the mean performance of all the departments and plotting its bar graph using seaborn.
        Analyze each department separately
        Plotting a separate bar graph for performance of each department using seaborn
 
# FEATURE SELECTION:
        Feature selection involves picking the most relevant attributes or variables from a dataset. 
        In employee performance assessment, "expected work" and "performance rating" are vital features.
        This process streamlines analysis, focusing on essential factors for data-driven decision-making and performance improvement. 
        It ensures a more efficient and effective evaluation of employee productivity.
